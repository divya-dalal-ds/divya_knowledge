      Bionformatics is an interdisciplinary field of science that
      develops methods and software tools for understanding biological
      data, especially when the data sets are large and complex.
      The author of essential bioinformatics is Jin Xiong. The term
      bioinformatics is coined by Paulien Hogeweg and Ben Hesper in 1970.
      Structural bioinformatics is the branch of bioinformatics that is related
      to the analysis and prediction of the three dimensional structure of
      biological macromolecules such as protein, RNA and DNA.
      In bioinformatics, a sequence alignment is a way of arranging the
      sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identify regions of
      similarity that may be a
      consequence of functional, structural, or evolutionary
      relationships between sequences.

      Computational biology refers to the use of techniques in
      computer science, data analysis, mathematical modeling and
      computational simulations to understand biological systems
      and relationships. An intersection of compute
      science, biology, and data science, the field also has foundations
      in applied mathematics, molecular biology, cell biology,
      chemistry, and genetics. Systems biology is one of its applications
      which consists of computing the
      interactions between various biological systems ranging
      from the cellular level to entire populations
      with the goal of discovering emergent properties.

      Perhaps the best known example of computational biology, the
      Human Genome Project, officially began in 1990.By
      2003, the project had mapped around 85% of the human
      genome, satisfying its initial goals. Work
      continued, however, and by 2021 level a completegenome
      was reached with only 0.3% remaining bases covered by
      potential issues.The missing Y chromosome was
      added in January 2022.
