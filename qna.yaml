      Bionformatics is an interdisciplinary field of science that
      develops methods and software tools for understanding biological
      data, especially when the data sets are large and complex.
      The author of essential bioinformatics is Jin Xiong. The term
      bioinformatics is coined by Paulien Hogeweg and Ben Hesper in 1970.
      Structural bioinformatics is the branch of bioinformatics that is related
      to the analysis and prediction of the three dimensional structure of
      biological macromolecules such as protein, RNA and DNA.
      In bioinformatics, a sequence alignment is a way of arranging the
      sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identify regions of
      similarity that may be a
      consequence of functional, structural, or evolutionary
      relationships between sequences.

  - context: |
      Perhaps the best known example of computational biology, the
      Human Genome Project, officially began in 1990.By
      2003, the project had mapped around 85% of the human
      genome, satisfying its initial goals. Work
      continued, however, and by 2021 level a completegenome
      was reached with only 0.3percent remaining bases covered by
      potential issues.The missing Y chromosome was
      added in January 2022.

          The human genome project.
      - question: |
          When did the Human genome project began?
        answer: |
          It officially starrted in 1990.
      - question: |
          what is HGP?
        answer: |
          HGP is the Human Genome project which officially
          began in 1990.By 2003, the project had mapped
          around 85% of the human genome, satisfying its
          initial goals.

      The Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium is an international
      scientific initiative that completed the first gapless
      human genome sequence. It builds upon the original
      Human Genome Project, which left approximately 8% of
      the genome unsequenced due to technological
      limitations. In 2022, the T2T Consortium released
      the T2T-CHM13 reference genome, which added about 200 million
      base pairs and included complex genomic regions
      such as centromeres and segmental duplications. The
      consortium later released the complete Y chromosome
      sequence in 2023. This work improves our understanding
      of human biology and enhances disease gene discovery.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the T2T consortium?
        answer: |
          The T2T Consortium is a research initiative
          that produced the first complete, gapless
          sequence of the human genome, including
          complex and previously unsequenced regions.
      - question: |
          How does the T2T Consortium build on the Human Genome Project?
        answer: |
          The T2T Consortium completes the work of the Human
          Genome Project by sequencing the 8percent of the
          genome that was previously unsequenced due
          to technological limitations.
      - question: |
          What is the T2T-CHM13 reference genome?
        answer: |
          The T2T-CHM13 is the first fully complete human
          genome reference, released in 2022, which
          includes nearly 200 million new base
          pairs not present in GRCh38.
  - context: |
      The T2T Consortium used cutting-edge sequencing
      technologies such as Oxford Nanopore ultra-long reads
      and PacBio HiFi reads to accurately sequence difficult
      regions of the genome. These tools enabled the assembly
      of regions with repetitive sequences and structural
      variations that had previously been inaccessible. The
      T2T genome has a total length of about 3.055 billion
      base pairs.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What sequencing technologies did the T2T Consortium use?
        answer: |
          The consortium used Oxford Nanopore ultra-long
          reads and PacBio HiFi reads to sequence complex
          and repetitive regions of the genome.
      - question: |
          How many base pairs are in the T2T genome?
        answer: |
          The T2T genome consists of approximately 3.055 billion base pairs.
      - question: |
          Why were the previous genome assemblies incomplete?
        answer: |
          Earlier genome assemblies were incomplete due to
          technological limitations that made it difficult to
          sequence highly repetitive and structurally complex regions.
  - context: |
      This complete reference allows researchers
      to more accurately identify genetic variants and study
      genomic diversity. The T2T Consortium's work also contributes
      to the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium to
      include genomic data from diverse populations.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What are some of the key benefits of the T2T genome?
        answer: |
          The complete genome enhances disease gene
          discovery, improves genome annotation, and
          supports the development of a more diverse
          human pangenome reference.
      - question: |
          When was the complete Y chromosome sequence published by T2T?
        answer: |
          The complete Y chromosome sequence was released
          in 2023 by the T2T Consortium.
      - question: |
          How does T2T contribute to the Human Pangenome Project?
        answer: |
          T2T provides a complete reference genome that serves as
          a foundation for building a more inclusive pangenome
          that captures genetic diversity from various ancestries.
